# Bridge Pattern (桥接模式)

## Definition & Explanation

The Bridge Pattern is a **structrual pattern** that **separates the abstraction part and its implementation part in two different layers, so that they can be developed independently: change in one part will not affect the functionality or development of the other part**.

<u>=> The client can only access the abstraction, without being concerned about its implementation</u>.

**这基本就是structural pattern版本的Strategy Pattern: 本质都是把一个system (or object) 的抽象和其行为分离开.**
