# Template Method Pattern (模板方法模式)

## Definition & Explanation

The Template Method Pattern is a **behavioral pattern** that **defines a sequence of steps of an algorithm, so that the subclasses are allowed to override the steps themselves, but not allowed to change the sequence of the steps**. In other words, in Template Method Pattern, we <u>put the general logic in the abstract parent class, and let the child classes define the specifics</u>.
