Note that in this example, the different behaviors are in the object creation process, and within the different behaviors (methods), we are returning the newly created instances: thus, this example is somehow related to creational design patterns.

1. Classical implementation: include makeIceCream() as a method in the interface IceCream
2. Incorporate Factory Method Pattern, and some concepts of Abstract Factory Pattern and Builder Pattern, and implement this example with factories
