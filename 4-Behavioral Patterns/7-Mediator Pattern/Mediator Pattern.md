# Mediator Pattern (中介者模式)

## Definition & Explanation

The Mediator Pattern is a **behavioral pattern** that provides a mediator object which acts as the communication center for objects: **when an object needs to communicate to another object, it does not directly call on the other object; instead, it calls the mediator object whose main duty is to route the message to the destination object**.

=> This design pattern is used to reduce the communication complexity between multiple objects.
