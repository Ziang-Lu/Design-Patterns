# Visitor Pattern (访问者模式)

### Definition & Explanation

Visitor Pattern is a **behavioral pattern** that **separates an algorithm from the object structures it operates on**.

A practical result of this separation is the ability to add new operations to existing object structures without modifying the object structure itself.

=> Allow for defining and easily modifying a set of operations to perform on the objects in a collection.
